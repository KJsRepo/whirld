x+y+offset % 3 EVERY THIRD TILE, run 3 times

when moving soil via water erosion, move 20% each to left and right of destination, and 60% to destination

Root length:
0 = all water is gathered from surface water, decreased erosion resistance
1 = all water is gathered from ground water, increased erosion resistance

Root spread:
0 = able to gather less water from low water source
1 = able to gather more water from low water source

Leaves:
0 = Gains less energy from sun, decreases moisture usage
1 = Gains more energy from sun, increases plant moisture loss, decreases evaporation on tile

Energy Storage:
0 = Expends little energy
1 = Expends lots of energy 

Metabolism:
0 = Spend energy growing
1 = Spend energy creating seeds

Seed size:
0 = Tiny, low mass, low stored nutrients, costs little energy
1 = Large, high mass, high nutrients stored, costs a lot of energy
